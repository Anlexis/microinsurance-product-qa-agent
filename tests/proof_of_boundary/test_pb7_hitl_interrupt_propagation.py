# PB-7: HITL Interrupt-Propagation Boundary Test
#
# PB-7 verifies that a human-in-the-loop (HITL) interrupt raised inside the
# agent graph propagates ACROSS the backbone / subgraph boundary up to the
# invoking caller — so an external orchestrator can pause the run, collect a
# human decision, and resume it. This behaviour is only meaningful for
# templates that opt into cross-boundary HITL propagation: a main-slot
# GraphNode declaring `propagate_hitl = True`, or an explicit interrupt()
# checkpoint on the 5-node backbone.
#
# INS-C2-031 does NOT enable cross-boundary interrupt propagation:
# ProductQAGraphNode declares `propagate_hitl = False`, the inner
# DomainWorkflowGraph runs a linear deterministic pipeline with no interrupt()
# checkpoint, and the backbone runs to completion. There is therefore no
# propagation behaviour to assert. This module ships as a real, importable test
# that SKIPS with an explicit reason — never as `assert True` — and carries the
# detection logic that would turn it back on if propagation were ever wired.
